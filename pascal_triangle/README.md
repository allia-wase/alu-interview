ure! Here's a **`README.md`** file for your Pascal's Triangle project. This is a clear and professional way to document your code, especially if you're uploading it to a GitHub repository.

## 🧮 Pascal's Triangle

This project contains a Python function that generates Pascal’s Triangle up to a given number of rows `n`. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

### 📁 Files

- **`0-pascal_triangle.py`**: Contains the function `pascal_triangle(n)` which returns a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
- **`0-main.py`**: A test script to demonstrate how the function works by printing the triangle in a readable format.

### 🔧 Function Specification

- The function `pascal_triangle(n)`:
  - Returns a list of lists of integers.
  - Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
  - Assumes `n` will always be an integer.

### 🧪 Example Output

For `n = 5`, the output is:

```
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```

### ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
3. Run the test script:

```bash
python3 0-main.py
```

### 💡 Use Cases

Pascal’s Triangle is widely used in:
- Combinatorics
- Probability theory
- Algebra (binomial expansions)
- Teaching recursion and list manipulation in programming
