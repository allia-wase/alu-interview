Minimum Operations - Copy All and Paste Problem
This project contains a Python solution to a classic algorithm problem: calculating the fewest number of operations needed to reach exactly n characters ('H') in a text file using only two editor operations: Copy All and Paste.

Problem Description
You start with a single character 'H' in a file. The text editor you are using can perform only two operations:

Copy All: Copies all characters present in the file.

Paste: Pastes the copied content to the end of the file.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reach exactly n 'H' characters in the file. If it is not possible to achieve exactly n characters using the allowed operations, return 0.

Example
For n = 9, the sequence of operations would be:

scss
Copy
Edit
H → Copy All → Paste (2 Hs) → Paste (3 Hs) → Copy All → Paste (6 Hs) → Paste (9 Hs)
Total operations: 6

Function Prototype
python
Copy
Edit
def minOperations(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of operations needed to get 'n' H characters.
    Returns 0 if n is impossible.
    """
Requirements
Python 3.x

Files
0-minoperations.py: Contains the minOperations function.

0-main.py: Test file demonstrating the use of the function.

Example Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
How It Works
The solution is based on the principle of prime factorization:

At each step, the optimal strategy is to factor n into smaller components.

For each factor f, we can build up the string by performing a Copy All and f-1 pastes.

We add f operations to our count and reduce n by that factor.

This greedy approach ensures minimal operations.
